description: Autonomous feature development with Peon-PO orchestrator

# Jon & Team

**Peon-PO** (called "Jon") is an autonomous orchestrator that designs features in your project's `docs/`, plans the implementation, and drives the build — all without you babysitting the process.

## How it works

1. **Describe a feature** — tell Jon what you want. He designs it directly in your project's `docs/` folder (business rules, BDD scenarios, ADRs).
2. **Review the design** — Jon acts as a skeptical guardian of the docs, keeping them coherent and always representing the desired state (SOLL) vs current state (IST).
3. **Plan & Build** — once you're happy with the design, Jon orchestrates his team:
   - **Da Thinka** (Peon-Plan) explores your project and writes a structured implementation plan.
   - **Da Mek** (Peon-Dev) reads the plan and implements the changes.
4. **Review & Learn** — Jon reviews the built code against the plan and docs, then captures learnings for next time.

```
User: "Add MCP support for web search"
  → Jon designs it in docs/mcp-web-search.md
  → Jon plans the implementation
  → Jon implements via his team
  → Jon reviews and closes the cycle
```

## Key principles

- **Docs-first:** Features are designed in `docs/` before any code is written.
- **Autonomous loop:** Plan → Review → Build → Retro — Jon drives the cycle with his team.
- **Skeptical guardian:** Jon keeps the docs honest, always distinguishing SOLL from IST.
- **Non-blocking:** Chat stays active while Jon works. Messages are queued and processed in order.

::: tip
Jon is opt-in. Peon-Dev remains the default agent for quick, ad-hoc tasks.

## Status indicators

When Jon is active, the header shows the status of his team members:
- **Da Boss** (Jon) — the orchestrator
- **Da Thinka** (Peon-Plan) — the planner
- **Da Mek** (Peon-Dev) — the implementer

Each shows a status indicator (idle / working / done) so you can see who's doing what.
